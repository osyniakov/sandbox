description: Drain a beads epic to completion unattended — dedicated branch, one bead per commit, reviewer-gated, bounded loop.
argument-hint: <epic-id>
---

Drive epic $ARGUMENTS to completion, unattended, within the bounds below. This invocation is your explicit authorization to skip the normal "stop and report before dispatching the next task" rule from CLAUDE.md — but that authorization is scoped and time-limited: it covers only beads under epic $ARGUMENTS, and it expires the instant the epic completes or any stop condition below fires. It never carries to another epic or a later session.

## Branch isolation (load-bearing)
Before touching anything, create or switch to a dedicated branch for this epic (e.g. derived from `$ARGUMENTS`, such as `epic/$ARGUMENTS`). Never commit to the default branch for the rest of this run. The human reviews and merges this branch by hand — you never merge or push it.

## Per-cycle loop
For each cycle:
1. `bd ready` scoped to epic $ARGUMENTS — pick the highest-priority unblocked task. If none, the epic is done; go to Completion below.
2. Assert a clean working tree before starting the bead. If it's dirty, stop and report — do not paper over it.
3. Claim it and mark in_progress (`bd update <id> --claim`).
4. Dispatch to the `implementer` subagent with a precise brief built from the bead's description, input/output, and done-criteria.
5. Dispatch to the `reviewer` subagent with the same bead id and its done-criteria. The reviewer must run the full test suite and inspect the real diff every time — never trust the implementer's summary in place of that.
6. Adjudicate:
   - Reviewer PASS → `git add -A` and commit, message including the bead id, one bead per commit (never batch). Then `bd close <id>`.
   - Reviewer reports gaps → route at most one fix pass back to the implementer, then re-review. A second failed review on the same bead is a stop condition (see below) — do not loop further on it.

## Hard ceiling
Stop and report after 15 beads closed in this run (or sooner if you judge the budget exhausted), even if the epic isn't finished. This is a runaway-loop backstop, not a target.

## Stop conditions — halt immediately, do not dispatch further work, and report to the human
- A bead fails review twice: leave it `in_progress` with notes on what's wrong; do not force a third pass.
- Any full-suite regression: stop immediately, do not attempt to attribute the cause yourself.
- A decision needs operator input: spec ambiguity, scope change, or UX/semantics not already settled by the bead's description.
- Anything requires a push, a config change, or touching files outside the project.
- Two consecutive infrastructure/API errors: before concluding it's an API outage, check `bd memories` for machine-sleep or known-flake notes.

## On epic completion (or hitting the ceiling)
Run the full test suite once more. Summarize: beads closed, commits made (with ids), any follow-ups filed as beads, and residual risks that need human hands-on attention. Land the plane per the session-close protocol — file loose discovered work as beads, `bd sync --flush-only`, commit `.beads/`. Anything requiring push or merge authority is reported as a PROPOSED command for the human to run, never executed by you.

## Invariants — restate these to yourself at the end of the report
- One bead in flight at a time.
- One commit per bead, never batched.
- Never close a bead the reviewer didn't pass.
- Never touch the default branch.
